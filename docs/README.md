# Documentation Home

This directory houses repository-level documentation and architectural records that
supplement the public site content stored under `site/`.

## Directory Layout

- `adr/`: Architecture Decision Records that capture significant structural choices.

New documentation should live here when it does not belong directly in the
public site sources.
